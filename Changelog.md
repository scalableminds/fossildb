# Changelog

## Breaking Changes

 - The `GetMultipleKeys` call now takes a `startAfterKey` instead of a `key` for pagination. The returned list will only start *after* this key. [#38](https://github.com/scalableminds/fossildb/pull/38)

## Fixes

 - Fixed a bug where the pagination for `GetMultipleKeys` could lead to an endless loop if some keys are prefixes of others. [#38](https://github.com/scalableminds/fossildb/pull/38)
